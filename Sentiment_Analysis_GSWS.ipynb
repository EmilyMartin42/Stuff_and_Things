    "# Sentiment Analysis of Sexuality Research\n",
    "A project by Emily Martin\n",
    "\n",
    "For GSWS 0550, Spring 2022\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this notebook there follows the beginnings of a framework for analyzing texts, past and present, on the study of sex and sexuality. By analyzing articles using natural langauge processing we can hope to see trends that might not be immediately clear to a human reader. Because this is just a \"proof of concept\" project the actual analysis is not as important as the framework in which it was done and the conclusions for how such a framework might be used to advance the field of sexuality studies. Four articles were chosen at random to serve as tests for the NLP technologies and the most important distiction is that they are all from different decades. The goal of this project is to use sentiment analysis to see if the language used in scientific articles has changed, i.e become more positive or more negative, over time. The code is written in Python and uses the Pandas library as well as NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and SpaCy pipelines for the sentiment analysis. \n",

    "## An overview of sexology or, why we should care\n",
    "\n",
    "Sexology, as a \"scientific field\" came into being in 1886 when Richard von Kraft-Ebbing published his Psychopathia Sexualis, in which he championed the need for a science of sex that relied on cold, hard facts and not the musings of the poets (Koscianska, 21). Sexology became a hugely influential field, and its creation marks the point at which sex became the domain of the scientific, the medical and the \"factual\". These pioneers of sexology took it upon themselves to examine and classify both the anatomy and psychology of sex and then proceeded to use this \"empirical\" and \"undisputable\" evidence to decide what was normal and what was a stigmatized medical condition. Of course, these categories were entirely influenced by both the researchers and societies ideas of normality and naturalness and were therefore not, in fact, indisputable categories of sex and sexuality. \n",
    "\n",
    "Along with this came the view that sexuality was natural and an innate part of biological human nature (Seidman, 12). Sex, it was claimed, was such a huge part of our natural state that it could be used to describe any number of human actions. This natural sexuality was, of course, heterosexual (Seidman, 13). Sex was also thought to be incredibly important - relationships, of the married heterosexual sort of course, were only thought to be good if there was mutually satisfying sex for both parties (Seidman, 13). Sex was essentialized, but only to \"good\" kind. If all this sounds all too modern, that is because these ideas are still very much alive and are all thanks to these early pioneers in sexology. Their works and ideas have permeated so deep into our modern thought that we do not often stop to consider it. \n",
    "\n",
    "A crutial place where sexology has taken root is in medicine. Every aspect of sex and sexuality are a part of modern (Western) medicine. So much so that most of us never think twice about it, even as we go to the doctor for a sex/sexuality related issue. Not only is sexual health (and sexual \"health\", that which dubious scientific backing) a part of modern medicine, but as we have seen modern medicine also pathologizes certain anatomies and sexualities and thereby treats certain populations differently. Celia Roberts argues that therefore \"sex and sexualities are not 'natural' objects worked on or taken up by medicine, but are produced in these interactions in particular ways (Roberts, 59). Since there is so much literature on medicine and it is such a large part of our lives, this interaction between sexology and medicine is an important one to bear in mind when pursuing research in sexuality studies. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is not to say that sexology has only had negative consequences. While the pathologization of sexualities did, and continues to do, a lot of damage to many communities, it also allowed for these communities to be formed in the first place. Kos'cian'ska explores this connection in their 2020 work _Sexology_. Without the creation of these identities by sexologists and other \"scientists\" many people would not have been able to form groups and connections with others who were similar. Much of this is due to the fact that because sex was often not discussed openly those who may have felt different did not know that there were others like them. The creation of these new groups, often in the form of an illness or disease, led people to flock together and also led to a wave of activism. There were also many sexologists amoung these activists who advocated for rights for these \"othered\" groups and despite the fact that this placed even more emphasis on the naturalization of sexuality, it did improve the lives of many people (Kos'cian'ska). \n",
    "\n",
    "It is not only sexology that has had an effect on society, rather, it is a two way street and society has also had an impact on sexology. More specifically the rapid urbanization beginning at the end of the 19th century. As cities grew the demographics rapidly shifted and these new urban areas quickly become known for being \"cities of sin\" where homosexuality and prostitution flourished (Ben, 2017). This idea of homosexuality, and sexuality in general, being an agent and chaos and disorder is not new and in their work, Global Modernity and Sexual Science, Pablo Ben reflects on how the rise of cities coincided with a rise in commercial sex and the effect that these \"cities of sin\" had on the \"scientific\" science of sex (Ben, 2017, p29). This rise of commercial sex, and (more visible) homosexuality is often seen as the rise of primitivism and degradation. Combined with social Darwinism and the newfound pathologizing of sex the urban lower class who were most visibly engaging in commercial sex (either as consumers or workers) were classified as \"savages\" and delegated among the \"lower races\". These thoughts, however horrifying on paper, nevertheless invaded modern thought and are amoung those we must consider as we seek to further the field of sexuality studies. \n",
    "\n",
    "No discussion of sexuality studies would be complete without Michel Foucault whose oft-cited works led us to new perspectives on the ways in which we think about power and oppression. He argues that while we often think of sex as something never discussed and horribly taboo and repressed, we actually talk about it a great deal. This is evidenced by the fact that sexology exists as a field at all and that countless hours and pages were spent cataloging sexual difference and desire. In fact, Foucault argues that it is precisely this feeling of repression that makes us so keen to talk about sex. It makes it a political statement, an act of rebellion and since people like to feel they are going against something that is keeping them down we just keep talking about it (Foucault, 1990). He challenges the common thought that we can only liberate ourselves through sex - both the discussions and acts - and suggets instead that we must “define the regime of power- knowledge-pleasure that sustains the discourse on human sexuality in our part of the world” (Foucault, 1990, p11). Only by understanding this power can we really understand the mechanisms behind our discussions of sex and sexuality, only then can we tell if we have seen “repression” or “dissemination and implantation”(Foucault, 1990, p12).\n",
    "\n",
    "Through these theoretical frameworks we can see both the influences that sexology has had on modern thought, as well as the ways in which scholars have thought about and critiqued the current and past work in sexology and sexuality studies. It is also clear that there is ever more work to be done, especially since the ideas have ingrained themselves so deeply in our thought and literature. But how can we go about this?\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to do that is to analyze the way in which people past and present talk and write about sex and sexuality. \n",
    "While a person reading and manually analyzing and thinking about a piece of writing can be incredibly insightfull, all people are fallible and prone to bias. Because of this it can also be useful to use modern technology to look at these texts and one way to do this is to use NLP, or natural langauge processing. This is a broad field with many applications and uses, one of which is sentiment analysis, which we will use here. By bringing in an objective \"observer\" to the texts we might discover trends we either did not, or could not, see. Computers are very good at reading huge amounts of data and quickly telling you some facts about it. If a human reads an article they might tell you it \"seems pretty lexically diverse\", but in actuality the author just used the same few big words frequently. A computer, however, can tell you in a moment exactly how lexically diverse a text is (with a few caveats, which will be discussed further below). Adding this objective and powerful \"second reader\" can have a significant impact on scholarship and can add a new dimension that was not possible even just a few years ago. That is why this template for the analyzation of documents could prove advantageous for future scholarship. This projects aims to serve just such a goal, and to provide at the minimum an interesting place to start and at the maximum a template to use to analyze any articles of the readers choosing. \n"

    "Word and sentence count are fairly obvious. They mostly serve to show how long the article is. Tokens is more or less word count: it is the number of words + some punctuation. Types is where it gets more interesting - types are all the _unique_ tokens, For instance, we can see that there are a little over a third the number of tokens as types in the first article. However, because there are only so many words in the English language, let alone words that are commonly used, this ratio does not hold for longer articles, for instance, the thrid article has 10,186 tokens and only 2,814 types. The TTR, or type-token ratio, is used as a measure of lexical diversity in the document - a higher score means more unique words. **But**, remember the caveat that types do not increase along with tokens at the same ratio. In order to account for this we can account for length by only using the first 500 words for our TTR score. There are other ways to do this, including tf-idf (term frequency - inverse document frequency) but that includes vectorization so we will go the simplier fix route for now.\n"

This is done by assigning each word a weight - a number that is either negative or possitive depending on how strongly negative or positive a word is. For instance, \"kill\" would be negative while \"love\" would be positive. These weights can be added together to find the overall sentiment score for a piece of text.\n",

    "Wow, out of the first 1000 words there are very few that actually have polarity scores! That is not great for our analysis. We can also see that the words are not specific to sexuality studies, so any nuances in those words are not being picked up. If others wish to take this idea further it might be worth checking out what other sentiment analysis packages are out there, another one might be better for analysis in this field.\n",

    "### Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "Overall, it seems like while there are flaws with the sentiment analysis package that are limiting the scores this still seems like a good tool for exploratory data analysis. Using this code, with some article specific tweaks, anyone who wanted to could get some linguistic data on their documents. From word and sentence counts to type-token ratios and sentiment scores, this \"pipeline\" would allow for easy comparison of any number of articles. Dataframes can be huge objects, so while this only uses 4 articles there could be hundreds read in with no issues. Linguistic analysis can be very beneficial to any project and adds an extra layer that might typically not exist. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory: tying it all together\n",
    "We have seen that the study of sexology has had, and continues to have, considerable impacts of modern thought and literature, from modern medicine to identity politics and even discourses of power and repression. In creating a pipeline through which to analyze articles with an eye towards linguistics we have discovered ways to think about the text of these articles in new ways. Because so much of the influence of sexology has been subtle, the aim of this framework is a way to tease out those subtleties programmatically, since a human reader might not be able to pick up on everything a computer can. Through sentiment analysis, particularly sentiment analysis that used a package with more weights, new patterns in writing may be discovered and new layers could be added to current and future theories. Old theories could also be analyzed, and if such a framework was further fine-tuned it might even reveal new layers in these as well. I hope this will be useful to someone in the future who wishes to advance theory in sexuality studies and wishes to do so with the added benefit of linguistics and NLP technologies."
